## Portfolio

"Solving the problems of society with the help of emerging technologies is BigBoys' mission. It's mine too!"

üíª Building the iOS Product of LBB to connect millions of users with the Local/Indians Brands on the country's Largest & Fastest growing Social Discovery Platform "Little Black Book". 

My recent experience as a Software Engineer Intern (iOS) sparked a deep desire to serve society ‚ö°. I worked there on a Doctor-Patient Consultation app that solved the problems of thousands of patients consulting the doctor.

The tech stacks I am passionate about are iOS Development, Augmented Reality and Blockchain. I have published one full-fledged iOS App on the AppStore. This app is integrated with Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. Its purpose is to ease the kids' education very smooth and entertaining üå†. 

I've learned & developed some really cool projects on iOS which are uploaded on my GitHub profile. These apps include combined technologies eg. (iOS + Blockchain), (SwiftUI + Firebase), (iOS + AR + ML).

Wait wait wait.. one more thing....I don't have any pet but I often feed street dogs üêæ üòÅ.

### Extras

Apart from sitting in front of my MacBook, I love exploring what's the actual purpose of life! I don't have any pet but I often feed street dogs üêæ üòÅ. I'm an Apple Teacher (recognised by Apple) so I often teach others how to use Apple's Softwares. I'm leading an Environmental Society (a team of around 100 students)in my college where we keep organising lots of events related to environment like Plantation Drives, Yoga Drives, Village School Drives, Old Age Home Drives etc.
