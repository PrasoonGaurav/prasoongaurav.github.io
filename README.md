## Portfolio

üíª Contributing extensively to the Nykaa's LBB iOS application to let 22 million young millennials explore their cities & shop the most curated products on the country's Largest content - led discovery & e-commerce platform <a href="https://lbb.in"> "Little Black Book" </a> (Acquired by <a href="https://www.nykaa.com"> Nykaa </a>).

My past experience as a Software Engineer Intern (iOS) sparked a deep desire to serve society ‚ö°. I worked there on a Doctor-Patient Consultation app that solved the problems of thousands of patients consulting the doctor.

The tech stacks I am passionate about are iOS Development, Augmented Reality and Blockchain. I have published one full-fledged iOS App on the AppStore. This app is integrated with Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. Its purpose is to ease the kids' education very smooth and entertaining üå†. 

I've learned & developed some really cool projects on iOS which are uploaded on my GitHub profile. These apps include combined technologies eg. (iOS + Blockchain), (SwiftUI + Firebase), (iOS + AR + ML).

Wait wait wait.. one more thing....I don't have any pet but I often feed street dogs üêæ üòÅ.
