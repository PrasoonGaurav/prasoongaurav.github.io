## Portfolio

"Solving the problems of society with the help of emerging technologies is BigBoys' mission. It's mine too!"

💻 Building the iOS Product of LBB to connect millions of users with the Local/Indians Brands on the country's Largest & Fastest growing Social Discovery Platform "Little Black Book". 

My recent experience as a Software Engineer Intern (iOS) sparked a deep desire to serve society ⚡. I worked there on a Doctor-Patient Consultation app that solved the problems of thousands of patients consulting the doctor.

The tech stacks I am passionate about are iOS Development, Augmented Reality and Blockchain. I have published one full-fledged iOS App on the AppStore. This app is integrated with Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. Its purpose is to ease the kids' education very smooth and entertaining 🌠. 

I've learned & developed some really cool projects on iOS which are uploaded on my GitHub profile. These apps include combined technologies eg. (iOS + Blockchain), (SwiftUI + Firebase), (iOS + AR + ML).

Wait wait wait.. one more thing....I don't have any pet but I often feed street dogs 🐾 😁.
